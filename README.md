## About the Book
Exploring Bitcoin with Blockchain teaches readers how Bitcoin works from the ground up and how readers can use it to help businesses innovate and reinvent their business practices in the digital age.

The book covers some of the most important aspects of a Bitcoin network: blocks, transaction validations, mempool, different types of nodes, and the mining process. These concepts, such as timestamp and proof-of-work, are critical to understanding the Bitcoin system and getting practically started with Bitcoin. The book explains how to build payment addresses, define and secure wallets, and use BIP 0032 to construct HD wallets to begin Bitcoin transactions. This book helps readers to learn how to write Python scripts to create transactions, set the network fee, add security to transactions, and publish those transactions on the Blockchain network.

This book covers a lot of problem-solving exercises and programming tasks. It explores the Lightning Network, which allows parties to a smart contract to send and receive Bitcoins using their digital wallets without incurring small fees. While you're learning it in depth, you get the opportunity to try out onion routing, and different improvements like Schnorr signature, and taproot.
